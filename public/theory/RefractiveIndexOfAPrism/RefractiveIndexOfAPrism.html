        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>
          To determine the refractive index of the material of the prism by
          drawing i - d curve.
        </p>
        <h4>Apparatus:</h4>
        <p>Drawing board, prism, white paper, set squares, protractor.</p>
        <h4>Theory:</h4>
        <p>
          When a light ray is incident with an angle i at one of the refracting
          surface of a prism and emerges out with an angle of emergence. The
          angle between the incident ray and emergent ray is called the angle of
          deviation 'd'. The angle of deviation is minimum D<sub>m</sub> for a
          particular angle of incident i. At this position the refracted ray is
          parallel to the base with the incident and emergent rays are
          symmetrical.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <p>
          \( 2i = A + D_m \, and \, i = \frac{A + D_m}{2} \, ; \, 2r = A \, and
          \, r = \frac{A}{2}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\mu = \frac{sin\, i}{sing\, r}\, ;\, \mu = \frac{sin\left( \frac{A +
          D_m}{2} \right)}{sin \frac{A}{2}} \)
        </p>
        <p>
          \(Angle\, of\, prism\, A = 2 tan^{-1}\left( \frac{sin\left(
          \frac{D_m}{2}\right)}{\mu - cos\left( \frac{D_m}{2}\right)} \right)\)
        </p>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="2.png" />
        <p>ABC is the prism with AB and AC as refractive surfaces.</p>
        <p>PQE is incident ray</p>
        <p>EF is refracted ray</p>
        <p>FRS is emergent ray</p>
        <p>NN<sub>1</sub> is normal drawn at the point of incidence E</p>
        <p>NN<sub>2</sub> is normal drawn at the point of emergence F</p>
        <p>
          i<sub>1</sub> and i<sub>2</sub> are angles of incidence and angle of
          emergence.
        </p>
        <p>
          r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> are angles of refractions on the two
          surface 'd' is angle of deviation.
        </p>
        <h5>Determination of angle of minimum deviation:</h5>
        <p>
          A white paper is fixed to a drawing board. The prism is kept on the
          paper and the out line the prism ABC is drawn. The prism is removed. A
          normal NN<sub>1</sub> is drawn at a point E. A line PE the incident
          ray is drawn at an angle 35<sup>0</sup> with the normal. Two P and Q
          are kept vertical on the line. The prism is replaced. By viewing the
          images of P and Q through the refracting surface AC, another pin R is
          fixed so that the images of P and ! and R lie in a straight line.
          Another, pin S is fixed similarly so that the images of P and Q and R,
          S lie in the same line. The points R and S are located. The prism is
          removed. R<sub>1</sub>s are joined and extended to cut PQ extended at
          M. The angle TMR is measured.
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure is repeated for different angles of incidence
          40<sup>0</sup>, 45<sup>0</sup>, 50<sup>0</sup>, 55<sup>0</sup> and
          60<sup>0</sup> and the corresponding angles of deviation are
          determined.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="3.png" />
        <p>
          It is observed that the angle of deviation decreases first and then
          increase. A graph is drawn between the angles i and d. The minimum
          deviation D<sub>m</sub> is determined from graph.
        </p>
        <h4>Precautions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Pins must be fixed vertically.</li>
          <li>
            Care must be taken in determination the collinearity. The pins must
            be fixed only when they appear to be a single pin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Same prism must be used for all obsevations. And it should not be
            disturbed during the experiment.
          </li>
          <li>Angle must be measured without parallax.</li>
