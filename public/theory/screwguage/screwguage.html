        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>To measure the thickness of the given plate.</p>
        <h4>Apparatus:</h4>
        <p>Screw guage, and glass plate.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.jpg" />
        <h4>What is Screw guage?</h4>
        <p>
          A Screw guage consists of a U-shaped metallic frame 'F' a shown in
          figure. To one end of this frame, a flat shaft S<sub>1</sub> (stud) is
          fixed. On the opposite end of F, a hollow, long cylinder 'C' is
          fixed.The hollow cylinder has fine threads cut inside it and it serves
          as the nut. On the outer surface of this hollow cylinder, a line,
          parallel to its axis, called index line is drawn and is divided into
          equal divisions.This serves as the pitch scale(p), a screw with a flat
          tip S<sub>2</sub> having threads exactly identical to the threads cut
          inside the cylinder, moves through the cylinder 'C'. To the other end
          of the screw, a milled head 'M' is connected. To this milled head, one
          end of the barrel 'B' is connected. This barrel 'B' forms a jacket to
          the first hollow cylinder 'C'. The other end of the barrel in tapered
          and has 100 or 50 eual divisions on it. This is called the head scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          LEAST COUNT(L.C)=\(\frac{pitch\, of \, the\, screw}{No.\, of\,
          Divisions\, on\, Head\, scale}\)
        </p>
        <h4>Theory:</h4>

        <p>
          The screw guage works on screw principle. The distance moved by the
          screw in the nut for one complete rotation is a constant and is called
          pitch of screw. When the head of the screw is divided into say, 100
          equal division, then the distance moved by the screw for even
          \(\frac{1}{100}\)th of a complete rotation also can be accurately
          measured. Eventually this is the least count of the instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Least Count=\(\frac{pitch\, of \, the\, screw}{No.\, of\, Divisions\,
          on\, Head\, scale}\)
        </p>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <p>
          To find the thickness of a thin glass plate and the diameter of a thin
          wire or a small sphere using a screwguage guage we must first
          determine its least count. The head is rotated through a certain
          number of complete rotations. The distance moved by the screw is
          measured from the displacement of head scale edge on the pitch scale.
          then
        </p>
        <p>
          pitch of the screw=\(\frac{Distance\, moved}{No.\, of\, rotations}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          and Least Count=\(\frac{pitch\, of \, the\, screw}{No.\, of\,
          Divisions\, on\, Head\, scale}\)
        </p>
        <h4>Zero Error:</h4>
        <p>
          There are two types of zero errors depending on whether the zeroth
          division of the head scale is below or above the index line. Figure
          (a) shows no zero error situation.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="2.jpg" />
        <h4>Negative Zero Error:</h4>
        <p>
          If the zeroth division of the head scale is above the index line,the
          error is said to be negative and the correction has to be positive.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="3.jpg" />
        <h4>Positive Zero Error:</h4>
        <p>
          If the zero'th division of the head scale is below the index line of
          the pitch scale, the error is said to be positive and the correction
          is negative
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="4.jpg" />
        <h4>Thisckness of the Glass Plate:</h4>
        <p>
          The given glass plate is held between the screw tip and fixed stud.
          The value of the highest division on the pitch scale is taken as pitch
          scale reading(P.S.R). The number of head scale division coinciding
          with the index line is taken as observed head scale reading,correction
          is added to this to correct head scale eading(n). It is multiplied by
          the least count to get the fraction of a pitch scale reading. This
          fraction is added to the pitch scale reading to get the total reading
          or correct thickness of the glass plate.
        </p>
        <p>Then,Total reading=P.S.R +(n*L.C)</p>
        <p>
          Changing the position of the glass plate between the stud and screw
          tip, 4 or 5 reading are taken to get the average thickness of the
          glass plate.
        </p>
        <h4>Precautions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Screw must be rotated by holding only milled head with safety
            device.
          </li>
          <li>All the readings should be taken in mm or cm.</li>
          <li>P.S.R and H.S.R are noted without parallax error.</li>
          <li>
            Each time before taking readings, it must be ensured that screw tip
            just touches the suface rocking or rotation test.
          </li>
