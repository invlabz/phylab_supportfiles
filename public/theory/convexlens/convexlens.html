        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>To determine the focal length of the convex lens.</p>
        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        <p>Convex lens,optical bench,object,lens stand and screen.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Distant object method:</strong> The convex lens is mounted
          in the'V' groove of the lens stand with its principal axis
          horizontally.The lens is focussed towards a distant object like a tall
          tree(palm tree) or electrical pole through the window of the
          laboratory.The position of the screen is adjusted on the other side of
          the lens until a clear image is formed on ot.The distance between the
          lens and the screen directly gives approximate focal length of the
          lens.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) U-V method:</strong> The covex lens mounted on the lens
          stand is placed on the optical bench and the object stand convex
          lens,optical bench,object,lens stand and screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Containing wire mesh or cross wires is kept at some distance 'u' from
          it.The wire mesh is illuminated to get a bright image.The position of
          the screen on the other side of the lens is adjusted untill a clear
          image is formed on it.If 'v' is the distance of
          <strong>the screen from the lens,the focal length.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>\(f=\frac{uv}{u+v}cm\)</p>
        <p>
          the experiment is repeated by increasing the values of'u' in steps of
          5 cm starting from a convenient value less than 2f so that at least
          two readings are obtained with valuesof 'u' less than 2f.The mean
          focal length 'f' of the lens calculated from those obtained from the
          obsrvation the radings are tablated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) u-v graph method:</strong> A graph drawn with 'u' on the
          X-axis and V on the Y-axis for the same scale is a rectangular
          hyperbola as shown in the figure.An angular bisector'OA' is drawn at
          the origin to meet the graph at 'A'.The 'X' or 'Y' coordinate of 'A'
          is equal to 2f according to scale.
        </p>
        <p>\(\therefore f=\frac{OB+OC}{4}cm\)</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="2.png" />
        <p>
          d) \(\frac{1}{u},\frac{1}{v}\) graph: Another graph drawn with
          \(\frac{1}{u}\) on the X-axis and \(\frac{1}{v}\) on the Y-axis to the
          same scale is a straight line.When extended on both sides this line
          makes equal intercepts OA and OB on the both the axes each of which is
          equal to \(\frac{1}{f}\).
        </p>
        <p>\(\therefore f=\frac{2}{OA+OB}cm\)</p>
        <p>
          \(if\, u-v\, graph\, method\, f=\frac{OC}{2}(or)\, f=\frac{OB}{2}\, or
          \, \frac{OC+OB}{4}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          \(In\, \frac{1}{u}-\frac{1}{v} graph,f=\frac{1}{OA}or \frac{1}{OB}
          or\frac{2}{OA+OB}\)
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="3.png" />
        <p>
          <strong>e)Lens displacement method or conjugate foci method:</strong>
          The object stand 'O' and screen 'S' are placeed on the optical bench
          seperated by a distance'l' greater than 4f.The lens stand is first
          placed very close to the object and then slowly moved towards the
          screen.At a certain position d<sub>1</sub>, a clear and magnified
          image forms on the screen. After nothing this position,the lens is
          further moved towards the screen untill a diminished clear image forms
          on the screen. The position d<sub>2</sub> of the lens is noted on the
          scale attached to the optical bench.The displacement of the lens
          d=d<sub>1</sub>~d<sub>2</sub> For the two images is obtained.Then,the
          focal length is determined by \(f=\frac{l^{2}-d^{2}}{4l}cm\)
        </p>
        <p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          'l' can be changed to obtained different sets of readings for
          calculating the mean focal length.The readings are tabulated.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(In\, \frac{1}{u},\frac{1}{v}\, graph\, at\, point\,
          A,\frac{1}{v}=0\Rightarrow u=\alpha ;\)
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>\(at\, point\, B\Rightarrow \frac{1}{u}=0\Rightarrow v=\alpha;\)</p>
        <p>
          \(\therefore \frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{u}=OA\, (or)\,
          \frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{v}=OB\)
        </p>
        <h3>Precautions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The distance of object should be more than focal length</li>
          <li>Readings should be taken without parallax</li>
          <li>The lens should be vertical in the V-stand.</li>
          <li>
            The entire of convex lens,the screen and the object should be along
            same horizontal line.
          </li>
