        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>
          To determine the velocity of sound in air at room temperature using
          resonating apparatus.
        </p>
        <h3>Appatatus:</h3>
        Resonance apparatus,tuning forks of different frequencies,rubber hammer
        and water.
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <p>
          The apparatus is a closed organ pipe.If L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub
            >2</sub
          >
          are the first and second resonating length of the air column then
        </p>
        <p>\(L_{1}+e=\frac{\lambda }{4}:\, l_{2}+e=\frac{3\lambda}{4}\)</p>
        <p>Where '\(\lambda\)' is the wave length:'e' is the end correction</p>
        <p>
          \((L_{2}-L_{1})=\frac{3\lambda }{4}-\frac{\lambda }{4}=\frac{\lambda
          }{2}\)
        </p>
        <p>\(\lambda =2(L_{2}-L_{1})\)</p>
        <p>
          'n' is the frequency of the resonating air column which is determined
          by resonance method.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(V=n\lambda :V=2n(L_{2}-L_{1}):V\, gives\, the\, velocity\, of\,
          the\, sound\, in\, air.\)
        </p>

        <h3>Desciption:</h3>
        <h4>Apparatus type 1:</h4>
        <p>
          The apparatus consists of a glass tube PQ of length nearly 1 meter and
          of diameter about 4cm,fixed to a vertical wooden stand as shown in the
          figure.The bottom of the tube is connected to a reservoir R by a hard
          rubber tube.There is a provision to move the reservoir vertically
          upwards or vertically downwards or to fix at any desired position.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <h4>Apparatus type 2:</h4>
        <p>
          The apparatus consists of a metal tube PQ of length nearly 1 meter and
          of diameter about 4cm along with a transparent side tube AB connected
          at its bottom. The water in the metal tube and that of in side tube Ab
          are at same level.Hence the water level can be noted from AB.These are
          fixed to a vertical wooden stand as shown.The bottom of the tube is
          connected to a reservoir R by a hard rubber tube.There is a provision
          to move the reservoir vertically up or down or to fix at any desired
          position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water is taken in the tube PQ along with reservoir.The water level in
          the tube can be changed by moving the reservoir vertically.Thus the
          length of the air i the tube PQ can be changed.A meter scale is fixed
          by the side of the tube,so that the zero of the scale coincides with
          the upper edge of the tube.This helps to measure the length of the air
          column by nothing the water level in the tube.
        </p>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>
          The reservoir R is adjusted so that the glass tube is filled with
          water.A tuning fork of known frequency n<sub>1</sub> is excited with a
          rubber hammer.The vibrating tunning fork is held horizontally above
          the tube so that the prongs vibrate in the vertical plane.The length
          of the air column increased gradually by moving down the reservoir.It
          is seen that the fork maintains the vibrations during this change. If
          at a particular length of air column a booming sound is heard.This is
          due to resonance now the of the air column is equal to that of the
          fork.At this position the reservoir is clamped and the length
          'L<sub>1</sub>' ofthe air column is measured by noting the level of
          the water in tube.The procedure is repeated again the resonating
          length is determined.The average of the length L<sub>1</sub> is
          calculated
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of the air column is further increased by moving the
          reservoir downward untill the booming sound time.The reservoir is
          clamped when the booming sound is maximum and then the length of the
          air column is measured.This procedure is repeated and again the length
          of the air column is determined.The average of the two length L<sub
            >2</sub
          >
          gives the second resonating length for the same tuning fork.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the formula V=2n(L<sub>2</sub> -L<sub>1</sub>) the velocity of
          the sound in air is calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure is repeated for different fork and the readings are
          tabulated.The velocity of the sound is determined in each case and the
          average velocity of sound at room temperature v<sub>t</sub> is
          calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the formula \(v_{0}=v_{t}[1-\frac{t}{546}]\).The velocity at
          0<sup>0</sup>C V<sub>0</sub> is calculated. Knowing the room
          temperature."t".
        </p>
        <h3>Precautions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The reading of water level must be taken without any parallax error.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fork must be excited by hitting the prongs with a rubber hammer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Care must be taken so that the fork maintains the vibrations during
            the location of the resonating length.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fork must be held horizontal so that the prongs vibrate in
            vertical plane.
          </li>
