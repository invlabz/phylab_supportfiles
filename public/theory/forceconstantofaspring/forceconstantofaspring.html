        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>
          To find the force constant and effective mass of a helical spring by
          plotting T<sup>2</sup> -m graph using method of oscilation.
        </p>
        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        <p>
          Light weight helical spring with a pointer attached the lower case and
          a hook/ring for suspending it from a hanger,(diameter of the spring
          may be about.1-1.5cm inside or same as that in a spring balence of 100
          g). a rigid support,hanger and five slotted weights of 10g each(in
          case the spring constant is of high value one may use slotted weights
          of 20g).clamp stand, a balence, a measure scale(15-30cm) and a
          stop-watch(with smallest division of 0.1sec).
        </p>
        <h3>Principle:</h3>
        <p>Spring constant(or force constant) of spring is given by</p>
        <p>\(Spring\, constant\, K=\frac{Restoring\, \, forces}{Extension}\)</p>
        <p>
          Thus,spring constant is the restoring force per unit extension in the
          spring.Its value is determined by the elastic prorperties of the
          apring.A given object ia attached to the free end of a spring which is
          suspended from a rigid point support(a nail,fixed to a wall).If the
          object is pulled down and then released,it executes simple harmonic
          oscillations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time period(T) of oscillations of a helical spring of spring
          constant K is given by the relation for time period.
        </p>
        <p>\(T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\)</p>
        <p>
          where m is the mass of the suspended object.If the spring has a large
          mass of its own, the expression changes to
        </p>
        <p>\(T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m_{0}+m_{1}}{k}}\)</p>
        <p>
          where m<sub>0</sub> and m are the effective masses of the spring
          system(the spring along with the pointer and the hanger) and the
          suspended object respectively.The time period of a spring(having large
          sprong constant is small)
        </p>
        <p>
          To eliminate the term m<sub>0</sub> of the spring system appearing in
          expression for T<sub>1</sub> we can suspend two different
          objects(loads) of masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> and measure
          their respective periods of oscillations T<sub>1</sub>,T<sub>2</sub>
          and then,
        </p>
        <p>
          \(T_{1}=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m_{0}+m_{1}}{k}}\, \, and\, T_{2}=2\pi
          \sqrt{\frac{m_{0}+m_{2}}{k}}\)
        </p>
        <p>on eliminating m<sub>0</sub> from the above equation,we ger</p>
        <p>
          \(\mathbf{K=\frac{4\pi ^{2}(m_{1}-m_{2})}{(T_{1}^{2}-T_{2}^{2})}}\)
          expresion(1)
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the above eqation and knowing the value of
          m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>,T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> the spring
          constant K of the spring system can be determined.

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Suspended the helical spring SA(having pointer P and the hanger H at
            its free end A),from a rigid support,as shown in fig.1
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the measuring scale,close to spring vertically.Take care the
            pointer P moves freely over the scale without touching it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Find out the least count of the measuring scalr(it is usually 1mm or
            0.1cm)
          </li>
          <li>
            Familiarise yourself with the working of the stop-watch and find its
            lowest division value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suspended the load or slotted weight with mass m<sub>1</sub> on the
            hanger gently.Wait till the pointer comes to rest. This is
            equilibrium position for the given load. Pull the load slightly
            downwards and then release it gently so that it is set into
            oscillations in a vertical plane about its rest(or
            euuilibrium)position. The rest position(x) of the pointer P on the
            scale is the reference or mean position for the given load. Start
            the stop-watch as the pointer P just crocess its mean
            position(say,from upward to downwards) and simultaneously begin to
            count the oscillation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep on counting the oscillation as the pointer crocess the mean
            position(x) in the same direction. Stop the watch aftern(say,5 to
            10) oscillations are complete.Note the time(t) taken by the
            oscillating loads for n oscillations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat this observation atleast thrice and in each occasion note the
            time taken for the same number(n) of socillations.Find the mean
            timr(t<sub>1</sub>),for oscillations and compute the time for on
            oscillation,i.e., the time period T<sub>1</sub>(=t<sub>1</sub>/n) of
            oscillating helical spring with a load m<sub>1</sub>
          </li>
          <li>Repeat steps 5,6 and 7 for two more slotted weights.</li>
          <li>
            Calculate time period of oscillation T=1/n for each weight and
            tabulate your observations,
          </li>
          <li>
            Compute the value of spring
            costant(K<sub>1</sub>,K<sub>2</sub>,K<sub>2</sub>) for each
            combinationof m<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>2</sub> and m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub
              >3</sub
            >
            and m<sub>2</sub>,m<sub>3</sub> using expression(1) for K and Find
            out the mean value of spring constant K of the given helical spring.
          </li>
          <li>
            The value of K can also be determined by plotting a graph of
            T<sup>2</sup>vs m with T<sup>2</sup> on y-axis and m on x-axis.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>
          The number of oscillation,n should be large enough to keep the error
          minimum in measurable of time.One convenient method to decide on the
          number n is based on the smallest value measurable of the
          stop-watch.If the least count of the stop-watch is 0.1 s,then to have
          1% error in measurement,the minimum time measured should be 10.0
          s.hence the number n for oscillations should be so chosen that
          oscillating mass takes more than 10.0 s to complete them.
        </p>
        <h3>Precautions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>parallax error should be avoided while taking th readings.</li>
          <li>
            The load applied on the spring should be within the elastic limit.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the spring is making oscillations in the vertical plane.the
            pointer should move freely over the scale without touching it.
          </li>
          <li>Time should be measured accurately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        Spring constant of the given helical spring=.......N/m.
