First the tips of the calliper are adjusted to fit across the points to be measured and the calliper is then removed and the distance between the tips is measured using a ruler. "

      "text": "The modern Vernier calliper was invented by Joseph R. Brown in 1851. It was the first practical tool for exact measurements that could be sold at an affordable price to ordinary machinists.   The Vernier Calliper consists of a main scale fitted with a jaw at one end. Another jaw, containing the vernier scale, moves over the main scale. When the two jaws are in contact, the zero of the main scale and the zero of the Vernier scale should coincide. If both the zeros do not coincide, there will be a positive or negative zero error."

In case of vernier calipers it occurs when a zero on main scale does not coincide with a zero on vernier scale. The zero error may be of two types: when the scale is towards numbers greater than zero it is positive; else negative. The method to use a vernier scale or caliper with zero error is to use the formula: actual reading = main scale + vernier scale − (zero error)."

Alignment of linear and rotational mathematics is a difficult but interesting task as previously described by Pierre Vernier and much elaborated in later ages."
