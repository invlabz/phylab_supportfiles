        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>
          The line joining the earth south-north direction is drawn with the
          hepl of the magnetic compass needle.This gives the direction of
          magnetic meridian.Magnet is kept on this line with its N pole towards
          the earth north.
        </p>
        <p>
          The compass needle is arranged near the pole of magnet such that its
          'S' polecincidind with a point already marked.It aligns in the
          resultant magnetic field.Now the position of the 'n' pole of needle is
          marked with a pencil on the paper.Now the compass is moved so that its
          'S' pole of compass needle coincides with the point now marked.Again
          the needle align in the magnetic field there. now it,s 'n pole' is
          marked by the pencil.This procedure is continued untill the compass
          reaches the 'S' pole of magnet.All the pencil marks are joined by a
          smooth curve.This gives the magnetic line of force.The experiment is
          repeated by keping the compass at different points near N pole.A
          number of magnetic lines of force are drawn from the different point
          following the above procedure.Now the compass is moved away
          perpendicular to its axis from mid point.At a point the needle aligns
          in any position showing the null point N<sub>1</sub>. The procedure is
          repeated on,the other side of the magnet and the other null point
          N<sub>2</sub> is located.The magnet is removed and the distance
          between N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> is measured.It is equal to 2d.
          and 'd' is calculated
        </p>
        <p>
          using the formula\(B_{H}=\frac{\mu _{0}}{4\pi }\, \frac{M}{d^{3}}\) M
          is calculated. And using M=pole strength(m) X length of the magnet(2l)
          pole stength 'm' is calculated.

        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <p>
          When a megnet is kept in the earth's magnetic meridian with it N pole
          pointing geographical south,two Null points are formed ont the axial

          horizontal component of earths magnetic field and B is the magnetic
          field due to the magnet.At null point the resultant magnetic field is
          zero.

        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>
          White paper is fixed to the drawing board.The line joining earth's
          geographical north and south direction is drawn with the help of the
          magnetic compass needle.This gives the direction of magnetic
          meridian.The magnet is kept on this line with its N pole towards the
          earth's geographical south. The compass needle is arranged near the N
          pole of the magnet such that it's 'S'pole coincides with a point
          already marked.It aligns in the resultant magnetic field.Now the
          posotion of 'N'pole of the needle is marked with a pencil on the
          paper.Now the compass is moved so that it's 'S' pole coincides with
          the point now marked.At this position again the needle aligns in the
          resultant magnetic field.Now the 'N' pole of the needle is marked by
          the pencil on the paper.This procedure is continued till the compass
          reaches 'S' pole of the magnet.All the pencil marks are joined with a
          smooth line.This is the magnetic field of force.the experiment is
          repeated by keeping the compass at different points near N pole of the
          magnet.A number of magnetic lines of force are drawn from the
          different points following the above process.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Now the compass is moved away from the center of magnet along the axis
          of the magnet.At a point the needle rotates on further moving away
          through a small distance a point is reached where the needle aligns in
          any direction showing the null point.This position N<sub>1</sub> is
          noted.The procedure is repeated pn the other side of the magnet and
          the other null point N<sub>2</sub> is located.The magnet is removed
          and the distance between N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> is
          measured.N<sub>1</sub>N<sub>2</sub> =2d Hence 'd'is calculated.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          \(Using\, the formula\, B_{H}=\frac{\mu _{0}}{4\pi }\frac{2M}{d^{3}}\,
          M\, is\, calculated.\) and using M=pole strength(m)XLength of the
          magnet(2l) 'm' is clculated.

        <h3>Observation:</h3>
        <p>

        <p>
          Distance between the null points N<sub>1</sub> N<sub>2</sub> =2d m.

        <p>\(\therefore\) d=m</p>
        <p>Geometric length of the magnet as measured by scale L= m.</p>
        <p>\(The\, magnetic\, length\, 2l=\frac{5}{6}L= m.\)</p>

          \(B_{H}=\frac{\mu _{0}}{4\pi
          }\frac{2M}{d^{3}}=10^{-7}\frac{2M}{d^{3}}\).
        </p>
        <p>\(\therefore\) calculate value of M= Am<sup>2</sup>.</p>

        <h3>Precautions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The drawing board must not be disturbed during the experiment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Care must be taken that magnetic materials are away from the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            The direction of the magnetic meridian must be drawn very carefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            The compass needle is gently tapped before locating its 'n' pole.
