        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>To draw I, V characteristic curves of a fucntion diode.</p>
        <h4>Apparatus:</h4>
        <p>
          p-n junction diode, Regulated power suppply unit, a milliammeter of
          range 0 to 20 mA, a micro ammeter of range 0 - 100 micro A, a
          voltmeter of range 0 - 10V and another voltmeter of range 0 - 1V
        </p>
        <h4>Theory:</h4>
        <h5>a. Forward bias:</h5>
        <p>
          When the P end lead of diode is connected to the positive terminal and
          n end lead is connected to the negative terminal of a battery, then
          the diode is said to be forward biased. The diode conducts the
          electricity if the applied potential is greater than the barrier
          potential. As the applied potential increases, the current strength
          increases.
        </p>
        <h5>b. Reverse bias:</h5>
        <p>
          When p end lead of the diode is connected to the negative terminal and
          n end lead is connected to positive terminal of the battery the diode
          is said to be reverse biased. The minority carriers constitute some
          flow of electricity. This current is the order of microamperes, and it
          is called leakage current.
        </p>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <h5>a. Forward bais:</h5>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <p>
          Connections are made as shown in the circuit diagram using voltmeter
          and ammeter with proper ranges. The resistance R<sub>s</sub> is
          selected for the safe current through the diode.
        </p>
        <p>
          The voltage across diode is kept at 0.1V. The corresponding
          milliammeter reading I is notedm the potential difference across the
          diode is increased in stepd of 0.1V and the corresponding milliammeter
          reading I are noted. 8 reading are taken and tabulated. A graph is
          drawn between the voltage and current. It is called the diode forward
          characteristic. The straight line part of curve is extrapolated to cut
          the voltage axis at a potential V<sub>k</sub>. This gives the knee
          voltage.
        </p>
        <p>The forward resistance of diode is calculated using the formula,</p>
        <p>\( r_f = \frac{\bigtriangleup V }{\bigtriangleup I} \)</p>
        <h5>b. Reverse biase:</h5>
        <p>
          The connections are made as shown in the circuit diagram, selecting
          the instruments of proper range. The voltage across the diode is kept
          at 10V and the microammeter reading I is noted. The potential across
          the diode is increased in steps of 5V and the corresponding currents
          in micro amps are noted and tabulated. A graph is drawn between the
          potential difference and current.
        </p>
        <h4>The graph:</h4>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="2.png" />
        <h4>Precautions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Diode should not be connected directly to the battery without series
            resistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            In reverse biase care must be taken so that the reverse biase
            votlage is well below the break down votlage.
          </li>
          <li>
            In forward bias, the potential difference applied must be increased
            in steps of 0.01 taking care that the current is not too large.
          </li>
