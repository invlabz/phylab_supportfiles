        <h3>Aim:</h3>
        <p>
          To determine the surface tension of water by capillary rise method
          using travelling microscope.
        </p>
        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        <p>
          capillary tube, tavelling microscope, beaker containing water, cork,
          bent wire, retort stand.
        </p>
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <h3>Surface tension:</h3>
        <p>
          'The force acting per unit length of a line tending to pull the
          surface apart along the line is called surface tension' of the liquid,
          and this is due to cohesive forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a capillary tube is dipped vertically in water it rises to certain
          height 'h' in the tube abovethe surface of water since the adhesive
          forces are greater than cohesive orces.If 'r' is the radius of the
          capillary tube 'd' the density of water,'g' the acceleration due to
          gravity and 'T' the surface tension of water,then
        </p>
        <p>\(T=\frac{1}{2}\left ( h+\frac{r}{3} \right )rdg\, dyne/cm\)</p>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          A Capilary tube of uniform bore is clamped vertically in rubber cork
          and is dipped in water. A bent wire is arranged besides capillary tube
          so that when capillary tube is dipped in water the tip of the wire ma
          touch the water level in beaker. The whole set up is fixed to a retort
          stand.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>
          The unifrom bore of the capillary tube of length about 20 cm is clened
          with pottasium dichromate solution to remove any grease or oil. Then
          it is washed with water. The lower end of the tube is dipped in water
          beaker and is clamped vertically to a retor stand. Due to capillary
          the water rises in capillary tube. Adjust the tip of the needle to
          touch the suface of the water in the beaker.
        </p>
        <h3>Determine the Height 'h':</h3>
        <p>
          The lease count of the vernier of the travelling microscope is
          determined. The travelling microscope with vertical motion is focussed
          on the meniscus of water such that the horizontal cross wire is
          trangential to the lower meniscus of water. The main scale reading
          below the zero of the vernier and the number of divisions 'n' on the
          vernier which coincides with a division on the main scale are noted.
          The reading of the microscope corresponding to water level in the
          capillary is given by
        </p>
        <p>\( S_{1} = MSR + \left( VC \times LC \right) \)</p>
        <p>
          The beaker with water is removed without disturbing the tube and the
          pin. The microscope is moved down and the tip of the pin is focussed.
          Again the reading of the microscope S<sub>2</sub> is determined as
          before. The difference 'h' between the readings (s<sub>1</sub> -
          S<sub>2</sub>) of the microscope is ntoed.
        </p>
        <p>Height of the water column h = s<sub>1</sub> - S<sub>2</sub></p>
        <h3>To determine Radius 'r' of the Bore:</h3>
        <p>
          After removing water fron the bore of capillary tube it is clamped
          horizontally to the retort stand and microscope is focused. Two
          concentric circles are observed. The vertical cross wire is adjusted
          to one edge of the inner circle tangentially and reading R<sub>1</sub>
          is noted. Then the microscope is moved to the other endge to note the
          reading R<sub>2</sub> and difference between R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub
            >2</sub
          >
          is diameter D and the radius 'r' pf the bore is D/2.
        </p>
        <p>The surface tension of the water is caluclated using the formula.</p>
        <p>
          \( T = \frac{1}{2} \left [ h + \frac{r}{3} \right ] rdg \, \, \,
          dyne/cm \)
        </p>
        <h3>Precausions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The capillary tube should be of uniform bore.</li>
          <li>The water should be taken in a clean glass beaker.</li>
          <li>The tube should be clamped vertically.</li>
          <li>Reading should be taken with out parallax error.</li>
        </ul>
