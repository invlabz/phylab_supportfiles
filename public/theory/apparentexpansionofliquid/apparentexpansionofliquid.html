        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>To determine the coefficient of apparent expansions of a liquid using specific gravity bottle method and 
            to calculate the co-efficient of real expansion of liquid.
        </p>
        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        <p>Specific gravity bottle,physical balance,weight box and a thermometer.</p>
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
    <p>Liquid do not possess definite shape,they take the shape of the container.So, they are heated in a 
        container.Hence the liquid have two expansions,one real expansion and other, the expansion with 
        respect to container,which is apparent expansion.</p><p>
        The coefficient of apparent expansion of a liquid is defined as the ratio of the apparent increase in 
        volume for 1<sup>0</sup>C rise of temperature to the orginal volume of the liquid.</p><p>
        if V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> are the volumes of a given mass liquid at t<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>C and 
        t<sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup>C respectively,then the coefficient of apparent expansion of the liquid is given by</p><p>
        </p><p>
        \(\gamma _{app}=\frac{(v_{2}-v_{1})}{v_{1}(t_{2}-t_{2})}\)</p><p>
        Relation between \(\gamma _{a}\, and\, \gamma_{R}\,is\,\gamma_{R}=\gamma_{a}+3\alpha _{g}.where\, '\alpha _{g}'\) 
        is the coefficient of linear expansion of the material of the container.

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Specific gravity bottle is small glass bottle with lomg neck and fixed volume fitted with a glass 
    stopped,with capillarybore.The bottle can be filled with the given liquid. When the stopper is inserted, 
    the excess of liquid above is fixed volume,will flow out through the fine bore in the stopper.</p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="a.png" />
    <h3> Procedure:</h3>
    <p> A clean,empty and dry specific gravity bottle is taken and its mass W<sub>1</sub>
     is determined along with its stopper.The bottle is completely filled with the given liquid at temperature t<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>C 
         without any air bubbles and its mass W<sub>2</sub> is determined.The bottle is suspended upto its neck in a water 
         bath with help of a thread.The bath is heated gradually.Due to expansion,the liquid oozes out through the bore in the stopper. 
         Remove the liquid that oozes with the blotting paper.</p><p>
         After sometime,the water bath attains a constant temperature.Wait for about 5 or 10 minutes until no 
         more liquid oozes out through the bore in the stopper.It indicates that the liquid inside the bottle  attains the 
         temparature of water and the expansion is completed.Note the final temperature t<sub>2</sub> <sup>0</sup>C of the water bath.
         Removed the bottle from the water bath. Allow it to cool to room temperature.Remove the thread and clean 
         the outer surface of the bottle with a piece of cloth.Find the mass W<sub>3</sub>gm of the bottle with the liquid left 
         over.Tabulate the readings in the table provided and calculated the coefficient of apparent expansion of the 
         liquid using the formula.</p><p>
         \(\gamma _{app}=\frac{(w_{2}-w_{3})}{(w_{3}-w_{1})(t_{2}-t_{1})}/^{0}C\)
         <h3>Precautions:</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>Find the masses in each case with the stopper on the bottle.</li>
             <li>Air bubble should not present in the bottle.</li>
             <li>The bottle should not be handled directly by hand,Hold it by using a piece of paper or cloth.</li>
             <li>The mass of the bottle is determined correct to a centigram using simple balance.</li>
         </ol>
