        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>
          To verify ohm's law by drawing R-cot \(\theta\) grapf and to determine
          the internal resistance of the battery used.
        </p>
        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        <p>
          At constant temperature the current ''i'' passing through a resistence
          box of range(0 to 10\(\Omega\)) Spirit level,connecting wires.
        </p>
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <p>
          At constant temperature the current ''i'' passing through a resistence
          'R' is propotional to the potential difference 'V' across the
          resistance.
        </p>
        <p>\(i\alpha V(or)\, i=V/R\)</p>
        <p>
          Where''i'' is the strength of the current flowing through a resistence
          R,V is potential difference applied Hence according to ohms law
        </p>
        <p>V=i R(at constant temperature)</p>
        <p>
          if 'i' is the current in the circuit having a resistence R and tangent
          galvanometer resistance G by applying a constant potential difference
          'V' by a source(battery or battery eliminator) with an internal
          resistance 'B' total resistance in the circuit is (R+B+G).
        </p>
        <p>
          \(i=k\, tan\theta =\frac{V}{R+B+G}\: or(R+B+G)tan\theta
          =\frac{V}{K}=constant\)

        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>
          The connections are made as shown in the circuit with the terminal
          T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> of commuutator in series with the
          resistance box,key and battery.The other two terminals T<sub>3</sub>
          and T<sub>4</sub> are connected to the tangent galanometer.Close the
          circuit.Select some resistance R in the resistance box, so that the
          deflection is nearly 30<sup>0</sup>.The deflection \(\theta\)<sub
            >1</sub
          >
          and \(\theta\)<sub>2</sub> of the two ends of the galvanometer are
          noted.The current is reversed and the two more deflections
          \(\theta\)<sub>3</sub> and \(\theta\)<sub>4</sub> are noted.The
          average \(\theta\) of the deflection
          \(\theta\)<sub>1</sub>,\(\theta\)<sub>2</sub>,\(\theta\)<sub>3</sub>
          and \(\theta\)<sub>4</sub> is calculated
        </p>
        <p>
          It is deflection for a particular current i<sub>1</sub>.The experiment
          is repeated by increasing the resistence R in the box in steps and
          corresponding average deflections are determined.The readings are
          tabulated.
        </p>
        <p>
          A graph is drawn between the resistance 'R' on x-axis and
          cot\(\theta\) on y-axis.It is straight line.When it is extrapolated.It
          cuts the resistance axis.The intercept gives (B+G) value.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="2.png" />
        <p>
          (B+G) value is determined from the graph and the product (R+B+G)
          tan\(\theta\) is calculated for each resistance. The product obtained
          found be nearly constant with in experiment error verifying ohms law.
        </p>
        <h3>Precautions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The compass is gently tapped and the deflection are noted without
            any parallax error.
          </li>
          <li>The T.G must not be disturbed during the experiment.</li>
          <li>
            Select the resistance so that the deflections are between 30<sup
              >0</sup
            >
            and 60<sup>0</sup>.
          </li>
          <li>The magnetic material must be kept away from the TG.</li>
