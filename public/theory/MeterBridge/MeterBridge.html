        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>
          To determine the resistance of a given wire and to determine the
          specific resistance of the material of the wire. To verify the laws of
          series and parallel connections of resistance.
        </p>
        <h4>Apparatus:</h4>
        <p>
          Meter Bridge, Battery eleiminator, table galvanometer, high
          resistance, jockey, plug key and connecting wires.
        </p>
        <h4>Theory:</h4>
        <p>
          When the wheatstones bridge is balanced then \(\frac{P}{Q} =
          \frac{R}{S} \) where P, Q, R, and S are the resistances in the bridge.
          At the balance point the current through the galvanometer is zero.
          Meter bridge works on the principle of Wheatstones bridge.
        </p>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <p>
          Meter bridge consists of a uniform wire AB of one meter length,
          stretched on a wooden board. The two ends of the wire are connected to
          two L shaped copper strips. A horizontal copper strip is fixed between
          the L shaped strip so that two gaps G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>
          are formed as shown in the figure. Terminals are provided at the ends
          of the wire and at the ends of the gaps. These terminals are used for
          the connections. A horizontal scale is provided under the wire to
          measure the balancing length.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two ends of the wire AB are connected to a battery E and a key K
          in series as shown. The wire of unknown resistance X and a resistance
          box are connected in the two gaps G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>. The
          mid point P is connected to a Jockey J in series with a high
          resistance HR and a sensitive galvanometer G. There is a provision for
          the HR to exclude or to include in the circuit.
        </p>
        <h4>Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h5>To determine the unknown resistance X:</h5>
            <p>
              The connections are made as shown in the circuit diagram. To check
              the connections, the jockey is pressed near A and then near B. If
              the opposite defections in the galvanometer, are observed the
              connections are correct. A known resistance R is introduced in the
              resistance box. The jockey is pressed on the wire at various
              points starting from A with the HR in the circuit. The defelctions
              go on decreasing. Locate a point where the galvanometer shows zero
              deflection. This is approximate balance point. The HR is excluded
              from the circuit and the correct balance point J is located. The
              balancing length L<sub>1</sub> from the end A near the unknown
              resistance is measured. The remaining length of the wire is 100 -
              L<sub>1</sub>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The resistance x, R resistance of L<sub>1</sub> length of wire and
              resistance of 100 - L<sub>1</sub> length of wire from the
              resistances of wheatstones bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
              \( At \, Balance \, Point \frac{x}{R} = \frac{L_1}{100 - L_1} \)
            </p>
            <p>
              As the meter bridge wire is uniform, and as the resistance is
              proportional to the length, instead of ratio of resistances ratio
              of lengths of wire are taken.
            </p>
            <p>Knowing R and L, x the unknown resistance is calculated.</p>
            <p>
              The experiment is repeated with different values of R and the
              balancing lengths are determined. The reading are tabulated. The
              value of x is calculated in each case and the average value of x
              is calculated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the unkown resistance x and the resistance box are
              interchanged in the gaps. The experiment is repeated with
              different known values of R is in the resistance box. The
              balancing length is measure from the end which is nearer to
              unknown resistance. L<sub>2</sub> is the balancing length.
            </p>
            <p>
              \( At \, Balance \, Point \frac{x}{R} = \frac{L_2}{100 - L_2} \)
            </p>
            <p>
              Reading are tabulated and the average value of x is calculated.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>To determine the specific resistance:</h5>
            <p>
              The length L of the wire of unknown resistance is measured. The
              diamter of the wire at three different places on the wire are
              determined using the screw guage. The average diamter and hence
              the average radius r is calculated.
            </p>
            <p>\( s = \frac{X \pi r^2}{L} ohm \, cm\)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>To verify the law of series connection:</h5>
            <p>
              The experiment is repeated keeping a wire of resistance R<sub
                >1</sub
              >
              in gap 1 and the value R<sub>1</sub> is determined. Now the wire
              of resistance R<sub>1</sub> is replaced by another wire of
              resistance R<sub>2</sub> in Gap 1 and its value is determined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now R<sub>2</sub> is replaced by the two wires connected in series
              in Gap 1 and the combined the value R<sub>S</sub> is determined.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is observed that R = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>1</sub> verifying
              the series combination of resitances.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>To verify the law of parallel combination:</h5>
            <p>
              The above experiment is repeated with resistances R<sub>1</sub>
              and R<sub>2</sub> separately and their values are determined. Now
              the two resistances are connected in parallel and the effecttive
              value R<sub>p</sub> is determined.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is observed that the above value agrees with the calculated
              value from the formula \( \frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \) verifying
              the law of parallel connection.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Precautions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The resistance in the gaps are to be nearlyu equal.</li>
          <li>
            The jockey should not be dragged on the wire kepping the circuit
            closed continuously.
          </li>
          <li>Only small currents must be passed through the wire.</li>
