        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        To verify (i) the parallelogram law of forces and<br />
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(ii)
        the triangle law of forces.
        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        <p>
          Drawing board with two fixed pulleys at its top,teine string,three
          sets of weight hangers with weights, protractor and set-squares.
        </p>
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <h4>(i) The parallelogram law of forces:</h4>
        <p>
          ''If two forces acting at apoint be represented both in magnitude and
          direction by the adjecent sides of a parallelogram drawn from that
          point,then their represented both in magnitude and direction by the
          diagonal of the parallelogram dawn from that point.''
        </p>
        <p>
          If , the three coplanar concurrent forces P,Q and R acting at a point
          keep it in equilibrium,then according to the parallelogram law of
          forces.it can be shown that the resultant of any two three forces is
          equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the third one.
        </p>
        <h4>(ii) The triangle law of forces:</h4>
        <p>
          If a point is in equilibrium under the action of three coplanar
          concurrent forces,then they can be represented in magnitude and
          direction by the sides of a triangle taken in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a P,Q and R reoresent three forces acting on a point'O' and p,q and
          r indicate the lengths of sides of a triangle formed by drawing
          prallel lines to the three forces P,Q and R,then according to the
          triangle law of forces.
        </p>
        <p>\(\frac{P}{p}=\frac{Q}{q}=\frac{R}{r}\)</p>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          Take three strings and make a common knot at'O'.Pass the end of two
          strings over two frictionless pulleys A and B which are positioned
          apart at the top of the drawing board fixed vertically.Suspend the
          weight hangers P and Q from the end of the two strings,Suspend another
          weight hanger R from the end of the third strings Suspend another
          weight hanger R from the end of the third and adjust the value of R
          untill the point 'O' is in equilibrium.

        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <h3>(i) to prove the parellelogram law of forces:</h3>
        <p>
          Attach a sheet of white paper with the help of drawing pins on the
          drawing board.Focus an electric lamp on to the point 'O'keeping the
          lamp at same height as 'O',such that a clear shadow of the 3 strings
          in formed on the paper.Trace carefully the position of knot and the
          strings with pencil. Now a Y shaped diagram,is obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Represent the forces P,Q and R by OB and OD on a convenient scale from
          'O' with OA and OB as adjecent sides,construct the parallelogram OACB
          as shown in figure.Draw the diagonal OC from O to C and measure
          initial-scale length.Now OC represents the resultant of the forces P
          and Q.The resultant(OC) and equlibrium(OD) are equal in magnitude and
          opposite in direction.So,if R<sub>1</sub> is equal to the forces
          represented by the diagonal OC and \(\angle COD\)=180<sup>0</sup> the
          parallelogram law of forces is verified
        </p>
        <p>
          Repeat the experiment 3 and 4 times with different valued of P,Q and R
          and tabulate the readings.
        </p>
        <h3>Triangle law of forces:</h3>
        <p>
          Obtain the Y shaped diagrams as explained earlier.Draw parallel lines
          OX,OY and OZ to enclose a triangle as shown in figure.Indicate the
          direction of the forces on the sides of triangle by arrow
          marks.Measure the sides of the triangle ABC.Let p,q,r are the length
          of the sides parallel to the direction of forces P,Q,R
          respectively,The experimentis repeated with different values of P,Q,R
          and the reading are tabulated.<br />
          It is observed that\(\frac{P}{p}=\frac{Q}{q}=\frac{R}{r}\)

          The experiment is repeated with the body immersed in water and the
          parallelogram is constructed.<br />
          (b)When it is immersed in water<br />
          Weight of the stone in water W<sub>2</sub> = diagonal OC x scale.<br />
          (c) Volume of the given stone V=(W<sub>1</sub> - W<sub>2</sub>)cm<sup

          Weight of the stone : W<sub>1</sub>(using triangle law of forces)

        <p>
          The weight 'R'is replaced by the given sone whose
          weight(W<sub>1</sub>) is to be determined.<br />
          A trace of the thread is taken on white paper and draw parallel lines
          to the forces OP,OQ and OR,so that they intersect and form a triangle
          ABC.<br />
          According to triangle law of forces. <br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp\(\frac{P}{p}=\frac{W}{r}\)<br />
          Weight of the stone in air \(W_{1}=\frac{P}{p} \) x r gm.<br />
          The above procedure is repeated with the body completly immersed in
          water.And its weight in water is determined<br />
          If W<sub>2</sub> is the weight of the stone in water then,<br />
          According to triangle law of forces,<br />
          \(^{W_{2}}=\frac{P}{p}\times r\, gm\)<br />
          Volume of the stone(V)=(W<sub>1</sub>-W<sub>2</sub>)cm<sup>3</sup

        <h3>Precautions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The pulley should be frictionless.</li>
          <li>The weights should not touch the drawing board.</li>
          <li>The drawing board should be perfectly veritical</li>
          <li>
            While marking shadows of the thread the weights should not move.
          </li>
          <li>The hanger should not touch the board(or) table.</li>
