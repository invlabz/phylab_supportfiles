        <p>
          The distance between the point of suspension 's' and the centerbof
          gravity of the bob 'o' is called length of pendullum L. When the
          pendullum is pulled to a side and released it begins to oscillate due
          to restoring force ''mgsine\(\Theta \)''. The time taken for one
          ossillation is called the time period T. \(L\alpha t^{2}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          The acceleration due to gravity(g) is calculated,by using the formula
          \(g=4\pi ^{2}\frac{L}{T^{2}}\, m/s^{2}\)
        </p>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          An ideal simple pendulum is a heavy point mass suspended by
          massless,inextensible and torsionless string. But in practice it is
          not possible to realise it.A heavy bob suspended by a light
          inextensible string is taken as a simple pendulum. One end of the
          string is tied to the sphere and the other end passes between the two
          parts of a split cork held firmly by a clamp of the retort stand.The
          bottom of the split cork acts as point of suspension 's'.With the
          arrangement the length betwen S and the centre of gravith of the bob
          can be changed..Thus changing the length of pendulum.

        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <h3>(i) To determine the acceleration due to gravity :</h3>
        <p>
          Measure the diameter of the bob 4 or 5 timesin different directions
          with vernier caliperse and calculate the average diamter 'd'.Then the
          radius of the bob=\(r=\frac{d}{2}\)<br />
          Keeping a wooden block beneath the bob such that it just touches the
          bottom of the bob,measure the distance ''a'' with the meter scale from
          the point of suspension S to the bottom of the bob.The length of the
          distance ''a'' with the meter scale from the point of suspension S to
          the bottom of the bob.The length of the pendullum L=(a-r)cm.By
          adjusting ''a'' the length of the pendullum 'L'is kept at a desired
          value.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Adjust the length of the pendullum to 50cm.Draw the bob to a side
          through a small distance and then release. it begins to oscillate
          about its mean position O in the vertical plane, keep a pointer at O
          to note the number of compllete osillations.Start the stop clock while
          the bob is passing O towards left (or right). The 20 oscillations-
          Similarly not the time't<sub>2</sub>' fo 20 oscillations for the
          second time.The average time't' is calculaed.Then the time period
          \(T=\frac{t}{20}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          Repeat the experiment for the different length 60cm,70cm,80cm,90cm,
          and 100cm and tabulate the readings. The time period is calculated in
          each case.The values of L/t<sup>2</sup> are calculated in each
          case.The average value of L/T<sup>2</sup> is calculated.Using the
          formula \(g=4\pi ^{2}.\frac{L}{T^{2}}\).'g' is calculated.
        </p>
        <h3>(ii) To determine the percentage error:[note:-</h3>
        Take the standard value of''g'' as 980 cm/s<sup>2</sup>
        Percntage error=
        <p>
          where\((\Delta g)\) is the difference in the standard value and the
          experiment value of 'g'. is called absolute error.
        </p>
        <h3>L-T<sup>2</sup> graph:</h3>
        <p>
          A graph is drawn between L on the X-axis and T<sup>2</sup> on the
          Y-axis. The graph is astraight passing through the orgin.From
          graph,the value of L/T<sup>2</sup> and hence 'g' is calcuLted, using
          the formula \(g=4\pi ^{2}\frac{L}{T^{2}}\)<br />
          As the period of second pendulum is 2 second, the corresponding length
          for 4 is obtained from graph.<br />
          This length gives the length of second pendulum
        </p>

        <h3>(iv) L,T graph:</h3>
        <p>
          A graph is drawn between the values of L on th x-axis and the value of
          T on the Y-axis.The graph is a parabola as shown in the figure.

        <h3>Precautions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The pendulum should oscillate with small amplitudes.</li>
          <li>The pendullum should oscillate in the vertical plane</li>
          <li>During oscillations the bob should not rotate.</li>
          <li>
            Note the time for 20 oscillations using the pointer behind the
            string at the mean position.
