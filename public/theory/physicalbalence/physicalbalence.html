        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        <p>
          To determine the mass of a body correct to a milligram using a
          physical balence
        </p>
        <h4>Apparatus:</h4>
        <p>
          Physical balence,weight box and a body whose mass is to be determined
        </p>
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <p>
          The algebric sum of the moments about a point is zero.So load x load
          arm = Weight x weight arm
        </p>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          A Physical balence consists of a metal beam B with a central knife
          edge and it ests on the horizantal flat top of a brass ro passing
          through a vertical hallow brass pillar P.At the two end of the beam
          B,two knife edges K<sub>1</sub>,K<sub>2</sub> are provided and from
          them two scale pans P<sub>1</sub> P<sub>2</sub>
          of equal masses are hung down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bottom of the brass pillar P rests on the crank of the handle H.By
          working the handle the rod and hence the beam can be raised or
          lowered.When the balence is not in use,the beam restson two
          projections K<sub>1</sub> K<sub>2</sub> branching out from the upper
          potion of pillar P and the pans rest on the woden base under the pans.
          The bottom of the pillar is fixed to the wodden base and an ivory
          scale I is attached at the bottom of the pillar. A long pointer
          screwed on to the middle of the beam and the lower end of the pointer
          swings over the ivory scale.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="a.jpg" />
        <p>
          The wooden base is provided with leveling screws A<sub>1</sub> A<sub
            >2</sub
          >
          and a plumbline is attached to the pillar P. Nuts N<sub>1</sub> N<sub
            >2</sub
          >
          are provided at the end of the beam. The balence is enclosed in a
          wooden case provided with glass doors.
        </p>
        <h3>Resting point:</h3>
        <p>
          Resting point of a balance is the division on the scale against which
          the pointer comes to rest after the oscillations of the released beam
          die down.But it is a long process. So resting point is estimated by
          noting five consecutive turning points,three on the left side(starting
          side) and two on the right side.Then calculate the average of th
          tuning points on the left side and right side.The mean of thse average
          turning points gives the resting point.
        </p>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <h4>(i) To determine the zero resting point :</h4>
        <p>
          Adjust the levelling screws A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> such that
          the base of the balence is horizontal. The nut N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub
            >2</sub
          >
          are adjusted so that when the beam is released, the pointer oscillates
          equally on the scale from the central division(10),when the pan are
          empty.Keeping the pans P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> empty,release
          the beam and take five consecutive turning points starting from left
          as L<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and
          L<sub>3</sub>, Take the average of the left turning
          points[L=\(\frac{L_{1}+L_{2}+L_{3}}{3}\)], turning
          points(R=\(\frac{R_{1}+R_{2}}{2}\)) and the average of the average
          turning points (RP=\(\frac{L+R}{2}\)) which gives the zero resting
          point(Z.R.P).It must be nearly 10.
        </p>
        <h4>(ii) To determine the resting points and mass :</h4>
        <p>
          Place the body in the left pan and sufficient weights are added to the
          right pan untill the pointer swings symmetrically on either sides of
          Z.R.P.Then the resting point(R.P-1) is determined repeating the above
          process.If R.P-1 is less than Z.R.P removes 10 m gm from the right pan
          and note the resting point. If R.P-1 is higher than Z.R.P add 10 gm to
          the right pan and note the resting point.Continue addition or removal
          of weight in steps of 10gm until the two resting points one is
          lower(LRP) and the other is higer(HRP) resting point than the Z.P.R
          are obtained.The readings are tabulated and then the mass of the given
          body correct to a milligram is determined using the following
          relation.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(mass\, of \, the\, body\, W=\left \{
          mass\,corresponding\,to\,HRP\right \}+0.01\left \{
          \frac{H.R.P-Z.R.P}{H.R.P-L.R.P} \right \}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          \(mass\, of \, the\, body\, W=\left \{
          mass\,corresponding\,to\,LRP\right \}-0.01\left \{
          \frac{Z.R.P-L.R.P}{H.R.P-L.R.P} \right \}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          where H.R.P is high resting point than Z.R.P and L.R.P is low resting
          point than Z.R.P.
        </p>
        <h3>Precautions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Before weighing the body base must be levelled to be horizantal
            using the leveling screws.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initialy if the pointer does not swing symmetrically ajust the nuts
            N<sub>1</sub> N<sub>2</sub>.
          </li>
          <li>The beam is arrested or released gently without any jerk.</li>
          <li>DO not weight the body when it is too hot.</li>
          <li>
            Place the body to be weighed in the left pan and the weights in the
            right pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrest the beam before each addition or removel of the weights.
          </li>
