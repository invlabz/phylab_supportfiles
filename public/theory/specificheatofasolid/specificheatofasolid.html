        <h4>Aim:</h4>
        To determine the specific heat of a solid by method of mixtures.
        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        Calorimeter with stirrer,Regnault's steam heater,common
        balence,solid,thermometer and weight box.
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <h4>Specific heat:</h4>
        <p>
          The specific heat of a substance is defined as the quality of heat
          required o rise the temperature of unit mass of substance through a
          temperature difference of 1<sup>0</sup> or 1K.
        </p>
        <p>m=mass of the body in gram</p>
        <p>Q=Quality of heat absorbed</p>
        <p>(t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>1</sub>)=temperature difference.</p>
        <p>\(\therefore s=\frac{Q}{m(t_{2}-t_{1})}Cal\,gm^{-1}\,C^{-1}.\)</p>
        <p>
          Q is measured by method of mixtures by a calorimeter.The principle is,
        </p>
        <p>Heat=lost by hot body=Heat gained by the cold body.</p>
        <p>
          Heat lost by the hot body=mass of body X Specific heat X temperature
          difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat gained by the calorimeter and contents=Heat gained by the
          calorimeter + Heat gained by the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          =(Water equivalent of calorimeter and contents) X temperature
          difference.
        </p>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <h4>(i) Calorimeter:</h4>
        <p>
          It is cylindrical copper vessel provided with copper stirrer.To
          minimize the loss of heat by conduction it is placed in a non
          conducting wooden enclosure and the space between the enclosure and
          the calorimeter is filled with dry cotton or wool.To minimize the
          radiation loss, the outer surface of the calorimeter is brightly
          polished.Lid is provided to minimize the loss of heat due to
          convection.
        </p>
        <h4>(ii) Regnault steam heater:</h4>
        <p>
          It consists of a fixed metal tube AB bent at an obtuse angle.It is
          inside a cylindrical vessel.In the vertical part A of the tube another
          tube C is introduced. On account of the obtuse bending of the tube AB
          the tube 'C' can hold the solid in it and when C is raised or rotated
          the solid pieces fall from AB.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <p>
          The masses correct to centigram and determined using physical balance.
        </p>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <p>
          The mass W<sub>1</sub> gm of the clean,dry and well polished empty
          calorimeter with stirrer in it is determined. Water is taken upto two
          thirds of the calorimeter and mass W<sub>2 </sub>gm of the calorimeter
          with water is determined. Placed the calorimeter in the non conducting
          enclosure.Note the intial temperature t<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>C of
          the water in the calorimeter by means of a sensitive thermometer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mean while heat the solid in the egnault steam heater.When the
          temperature of the hot solid is steady, note the temperature t<sub
            >2</sub
          ><sup>0</sup>C of the solid.Place the calorimeter just below the spout
          'B' of the heater and drop the solid pieces into the calorimeter.Stir
          the contents of the calorimeter and note the resultant temperature and
          finally find the mass W<sub>3</sub> gm of the calorimeter with the
          contents in it.Tabulate the radings and determine the specific heat of
          the solid from the equation
        </p>
        <p>
          \(s=\frac{[w_{1}s_{1}+(w_{2}-w_{1})s_{2}](t_{3}-t_{1})}{(w_{3}-w_{2})(t_{2}-t_{3})}cal/g^{0}C
          \)
        </p>
        <h3>Precaution:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Loss of heat by radiation should be prevented by polishing the
            calorimeter.
          </li>
          <li>Thermometer should be removed with least loss of water.</li>
          <li>
            The solid should be in small pieces and quickly dropped into
            calorimeter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loss of heat by conduction should be minimum by keeping wool in the
            wooden box.
          </li>
          <li>
            The water level in the calorimeter must be sufficient to immerse the
            solid pieces completly under water
          </li>
          <li>
            Care must taken so that the water in the calorimeter does not split
            out during transfer of solid.
          </li>
        </ol>
