          Magnetic field 'B' is produced at the center of a coil carrying
          current. This is measured by the deflection '\(\theta \)' observed by
          the pivoted magnetic needle as in the case of deflection magnetometer.

        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>
          The tangent galvanometer consists of a vertical circular coil of
          certain number of turns of insulated copper wire wound on a non
          magnetic frame. This is mounted vertical on a horizontal base provided
          width leveling screws. The coil can be rotated about a vertical axis
          passing through its centre of the circular coil. It has a magnetic
          compass arranged such that its pivot coincides with the center of the
          circular coil. The compass has magnetic needle pivoted at its center.
          A long aluminium pointer is fixed perpendicular to the magnetic needle
          at its mid point. The combination can rotate in a horizontal plane
          about the pivot. The aluminium pointer moves over a circular scale
          with its centre at the pivot. The scale is divided into four quadants
          and calibrated in degrees to measure the
          deflection(0-90<sup>0</sup>-0-90<sup>0</sup>-0). A mirror is provided
          under the needle to avoid parallax error.The base has terminals
          attached to the end of the wire of the coil. The number of turns can
          be changed by selecting proper terminals (say 2,50,500).
        </p>

        <h4>Adjustments of Tangent galvanometer:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The base is levelled using a sprit lavel. The sprit lavel is kept on
            the compass parallel to two of the levelling screws. Screws are
            adjusted so that the air bubble lies at the mid point of the spirit
            level. Now the spirit level is kept perpendicular to the initial
            position with its end at the third screws. Now the third screws is
            adjusted so that the air bubble is at the mid point of the sprit
            level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The coil is rotated and arranged in the magnetic meridian by keeping
            it parallel to the magnetic needle.
          </li>
          <li>
            The compass is rotated so that the aluminium pointer reads
            zero-zero. The TG must not be disturbed during the experiment.
          </li>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="2.jpg" />
        </ol>
        <h4>Procedure</h4>
        <p>
          The connections are made as shown in the circuit with
          T<sub>1</sub>,T<sub>2</sub> terminals of the commutator in series with
          ammeter and rheostat. The tanget gakvanometer is connected to the
          other two terminals T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>. By connecting
          T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> by a plug key current flows through
          the tangentgalvanometer. If T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> are
          connected by a plug key, current flows through tangent galvanometer in
          opposite direction. Thus the current in the T.G can be reversed. The
          number of turns(n) is selected so that on adjusting the reeostat, the
          ammeter gives measurable reading and the corresponding deflection lie
          between 30<sup>0</sup> and 60<sup>0</sup> nearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rheostat is adjusted so that the ammeter reads 0.2Amp The
          deflections \(\theta _{1}\, \mathbf{and}\, \theta _{_{2}}\) of the two
          ends of the aluminium pointer are noted. Now the current in the TG is
          reversed and two more deflection \(\theta _{3}\, \mathbf{and}\, \theta
          _{_{4}}\) are noted. The average \(\theta\) the four deflection
          \(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\theta_{3}\mathbf{and}\,\theta_{4}\)
          calculated.<br />
          The current is calculated using the formula<br />
          i=K tan\(\theta\)<br />
          \(\mathbf{where}\, K=\frac{2rB_{H}}{\mu _{0}n}\)
        </p>
        <p>
          The experiment is repeated by increasing the current in steps of 0.2A
          and noting the corresponding deflection. The current in the circuit is
          calculated in each case. The readings are tabulated.<br />
          Radius of the coil is measured from perimeter of coil \(x=2\pi
          r\Rightarrow r=x/2\pi y\)
        </p>
        <h4>Precautions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            After adjusting the TG, it should not be disturbed through out the
            experiment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ammeter reading and deflection are noted out parallax error.
          </li>
          <li>
            The compass is gently tapped,on the glass top and then the
            deflections are noted.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ammeter of range 0-1 A is selected.The rheostat is selected so
            that on adjusting.the curents varies uniformly to the maximum value
            of 1A
          </li>
          <li>
            Ammeter is connected so that its positive terminal to the positive
            terminal of the battery.
          </li>

          <li>The rheostat and the ammeter must be kept away from T.G</li>
