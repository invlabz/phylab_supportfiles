        <h3>Apparatus:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Boyle's Law:</strong>At a constant temperature the volume(v)
          of a given mass of a gas is inversely propotional to its presure(p)<br />
          \(\therefore \, V\alpha \frac{1}{P} \, or\, PV=constant. \)
        </p>
        <p>
          Air is taken as expermental gas in this apparatus. The volume of air
          is propotional to the length of air column(L). Instead of proving
          PV=constant, it is sufficient to show PL=constant. If L<sub>1</sub>,
          L<sub>2</sub> are the lengths of air column at pressures
          P<sub>1</sub>and P<sub>2</sub>, then P<sub>1</sub>L<sub>1</sub>
          =P<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>.

        <h3>QUILL TUBE APPARATUS:</h3>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          AB is glass tube of uniform cross section of diameter about 2mm and
          length about 1m. 0nd of the tube is closed such that an air column of
          length about 30cm is enclosed by the closed end and a mercury pellet
          of length about 15cm. By changing the position of the tube the
          pressure of the air column can be changed. This tube is fixed on a
          meter scale and this is fixed to clamp of a retort stand. By adjusting
          the clamp the orientation of the tube along wuth the scale in vertical
          plane can be changed.
        </p>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" />
        <p>
          The tube along with the scale is fixed vertical with its open end
          upwards. Measure the length of the Air column 'L' between the closed
          end and the mercury pellet. Measure the vertical height h<sub>1</sub>
          and h<sub>2</sub> of the two ends of the mercury pellet from the tube.
          (h<sub>1</sub> or h<sub>2</sub>)=h the pressure difference. If H is
          the atmospheric pressure, the pressure on air column is P=(H+h). The
          product of P and L is calculated. the experiment is repeated by
          keeping the tube in different positions with the help of the clamp. In
          each position the length of the air column is measured. The vertical
          heights h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub> of the end of the mercury
          pellet are measure (h<sub>1</sub> or h<sub>2</sub>) is the pressure
          difference. If the open end is in downward position the preassure the
          pressure on the air column is P=H-h. Thus pressure are calculated and
          the products P x L are calculated. The readings are tabulated.
        </p>
        <h3>h-1/L graph:</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="2.png" />
        <p>
          Draw a graph taking h value along X-axis and 1/L values along Y-axis.
          The graph is a straight line and the intercept on the X-axis, i. e. ,
          OB gives the atmospheric pressure.
        </p>
        <h3>Result:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The temperature should be constant.</li>
          <li>The tube should not be touched by the hand.</li>
          <li>
            For every change of position of the reservior, wait for some time
            and take readings
          </li>
          <li>The tube should be of uniform cross section.</li>
